# News Project

This project is a **News Website** where users can view news from various sources in a visually appealing layout. The project includes features such as **dark mode** to enhance readability and user experience.

## Features

- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Users can switch between light and dark themes to make reading news easier on the eyes, especially in low-light environments.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, ensuring that it looks great on all devices, including mobile phones and tablets.
- **Dynamic News Content**: News articles are dynamically fetched and displayed in a card layout with images, headlines, sources, and descriptions.

## Dark Mode

When dark mode is enabled:
- **Navbar**: The background of the navigation bar changes to a darker color to match the theme.
- **Text Colors**: The color of the text, including headlines and news descriptions, switches to white for better contrast against the dark background.
- **News Cards**: The cards also adapt to dark mode, changing the background and text colors to ensure the content is always readable.

### Custom CSS Variables

The project uses CSS variables to easily switch between light and dark modes, ensuring that all elements, including text, buttons, and backgrounds, change appropriately.

- **Light Mode Text Colors**: The primary text color in light mode is dark, making it easy to read on a light background.
- **Dark Mode Text Colors**: In dark mode, the text switches to white, providing optimal readability.

### News Card Design

Each news article is presented in a **card** format, featuring:
- **Image**: A thumbnail or image related to the news article.
- **Headline**: The title of the article.
- **Source**: The name of the news source.
- **Description**: A short description or excerpt from the article.

When dark mode is activated:
- The card background switches to a dark color.
- The card text, including the headline and description, turns white to remain visible against the darker background.
- Hover effects are adjusted to match the theme.
